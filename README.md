The master problem Π is specified with an objective function
min E(x,a, p_a,i) combining the components to guide the search for
an algorithm. This function aims to minimize the error incurred by
the algorithm when solving the set of instances. Consider the minimi-
zation of the mean squared error and introducing penalty functions
to avoid algorithms with more than a predefined number of instruc-
tions, a predefined maximum running time, and a predefined maxi-
mum polynomial complexity, the master problem can be formulated
as follows:
1
Π: min E(x,a, p_a,i) = |I| Σ_{i∈Ω_I} (c(π_i)-c_i^*)^2
+λ_1 P_{instr} (a) +λ_2 P_{time}(a) + λ_3 P_{complexity}(a) (2.5)
Subject to:

x ∈ Ω; a ∈ Ω_A; p_a ∈ Ω_a; i ∈ Ω_I; w(π) ≤ W'  (2.6)

Where:

*   P_{instr}(a) is a penalty function for algorithms with more than a predefined number of instructions.
*   P_{time}(a) is a penalty function for algorithms exceeding a predefined maximum running time.
*   P_{complexity}(a) is a penalty function for algorithms exceeding a predefined maximum polynomial complexity.
*   λ_1, λ_2, and λ_3 are penalty weights that balance the importance of minimizing the error and adhering to the constraints on instructions, running time, and complexity.
*   c(π) is the cost function of the path π.
*   w(π) is the weight function of the path π.
*   c_i^* is the optimal cost, for problem instance i.

This formulation ensures that the generated algorithms are accurate, efficient, and practical for real-world use, addressing the constraints and objectives of the WCSPP.
